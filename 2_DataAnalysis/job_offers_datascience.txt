Data Scientist	Fundació de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu	Esplugues de Llobregat, Cataluña, España (Presencial)	              L'Hospital Sant Joan de Déu Barcelona és un dels centres europeus més importants en les especialitats de Pediatria, Ginecologia i Obstetrícia. Som un hospital d'alta especialització i tecnologia, de referència en l'assistència, la docència i la recerca. El nostre model assistencial compagina harmònicament la ciència, els avenços tècnics i la humanització, des del respecte a la dignitat de la persona. Anualment ens visiten més de 350.000 pacients.L’hospital, com a centre de referència internacional, aposta per una assistència i tractament del pacient humanista que te en compte l’experiència del pacient en tots els àmbits del tractament. Al ser un centre d’alta especialització, també integra les últimes tecnologies en el tractament i seguiment dels pacients. Un exemple és el projecte Hospital Líquid, el projecte de transformació digital que inicià el 2009 i que se centra en generar les eines i plataformes que permetin anar més enllà de les parets de l’hospital per tractar als pacients allà on siguin i empoderar-los en el procés de tractament. En el projecte PHEMS desenvoluparem i validarem un concepte d'ecosistema de dades de salut descentralitzat i obert, basat en estàndard (com el OMOP) i generat sobre 3 casos d’ús clínic de 4 hospital de referència en l’assistència pediàtrica a Europa. El projecte facilitarà l'accés a les dades de salut i ajudarà a avançar en l'anàlisi avançat de dades de federades,creant serveis que generen conjunts de dades sintètiques compartibles.El projecte PHEMS ha estat finançat per la Comissió Europea dins del programa Horizon Europe (Research and Innovation Action) i sota el grant agreement nº 101094195.Els socis tècnics, en col·laboració amb els socis hospitalaris desenvoluparan tres casos d'ús clínic, que utilitzaran diversos tipus de dades (per exemple, dades d'EHR, de laboratori i de monitoratge):  Benchmarking del tractament de pacients de cardiologia amb cardiopatia congènita: En aquest cas d’ús es crearà un dashboard per comparar les mesures de resultats dels pacients amb cardiologia mitjançant l'ús de dades federades i estandarditzades (OMOP) de GOSH, HUS, FSJD i ERASMUS. Aquestes dades de benchmarking s'utilitzaran per identificar les millors pràctiques en les vies de tractament per millorar l'atenció i la prestació assistencial dels pacients amb cardiopatia congènita, una de las patologies més complexes i costoses pel sistemes de salud. Predicció de Sèpsia de la Unitat de Cures Intensives Pediàtriques (UCIP): Se investigarà els beneficis de l'ecosistema federat PHEMS per desenvolupar, entrenar i provar algorismes que prediuen la sèpsia en UCIP de quatre grans hospitals infantils europeus (HUS, GOSH, ERASMUS y HSJD). Validar i implementar algorismes predictius de sèpsia aplicant tècniques d'aprenentatge automàtic per agrupar trajectòries de pacients de UCIP segons els resultats. Hematologia; hemofília: El cas d'ús clínic 3 desenvoluparà i provarà un algorisme de predicció basat en Machine Learning en conjunts de dades de GOSH, HUS, FSJD i ERASMUS per tractar pacients pediàtrics amb hemofília A o B. Aquest cas d'ús pretén mostrar que l'ecosistema d'intercanvi de dades de nova creació, mitjançant algorismes d'aprenentatge federats, augmenta el nombre de pacients inclosos en algorismes d'aprenentatge automàtic en malalties de baixa incidència. Millorarem la precisió d'un algorisme d'aprenentatge automàtic creat per un únic centre (ERASMUS) per predir els nivells de factor plasmàtic a l'hemofília A i B ampliant la validació als altres 3 centres. Finalment, compararem el rendiment dels models d'aprenentatge automàtic amb els models clàssics de PK per predir els nivells de factor plasmàtic.L'objectiu d'aques lloc de treball és incorporar un data scientist a l’equip multidisciplinar del projecte per donar suport transversal als tres casos d’ús clínics en què el HSJD participa, però especialment en el desenvolupament del algoritme de predicció de Sepsis en UCIP.Funcions principals:Donar suport al projecte PHEMS com a referent bioinformàtic en la preparació de les bases de dades dels 3 casos de us i en el desenvolupament e implementació de models predictius de SEPSIS en UCIP, coordinat amb els 4 hospitals de referència pediàtrics.LES RESPONSABILITATS:  Extracció i harmonització de les dades per a la construcció dades dels entorns de virtualització necessàris pel projecte. Utilització de les eines de preprocessat i anàlisi de dades per donar resposta a les necessitats del projecte.

Col·laboració en el disseny de les eines de visualització per a la presentació d’informació amb els entorns definits per l´organització. Col·laboració en el posada en producció del algoritme un cop validat, pel seu ús en un entorn clínic real. Gestionar, coordinar i impartir las formacions relacionades amb les seves tasques i àrees de coneixement al personal que els requereixi. Donar suport a les àrees tècniques i assistencials que formin part de l’àmbit d’actuació. Assistir a les reunions de coordinació transversal del projecte en què estigui involucrada.

Predoctoral Fellowship Contract Data Science/ Artificial Intelligence	La Salle. Universitat Ramon Llull	Barcelona y alrededores (Presencial)	              La Salle Digital Engineering School, Ramon Llull University (Barcelona) offers a predoctoral fellowship as part of the State Plan for Scientific and Technological Research and Innovation of the Ministry for Science and Technology of the Spanish Government to undertake a PhD thesis in the framework of the funded project:New Physics Searches and Data Challenges with the LHCb experiment at CERN.Summary of the project:LHCb is a particle physics experiment running at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The LHCb collaboration brings together 1600 members from 96 institutes in 21 different countries.The experiment has been collecting collisions data since 2010. The detector has been upgraded and has started a new phase of data taking in 2022. The experiment was designed to search for physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics through precision measurements of CP violation and rare decays of heavy-flavored (beauty and charmed) hadrons produced at the LHC. With the upgraded apparatus, the experiment opens the window to a new and exciting era with a higher discovery potential.Particle physics experiments involve scientific, technological and computational challenges. The change of running conditions in this new data-taking period has implied shifts of paradigm in data-acquisition methods, computing and analysis techniques, which are all challenges in the context of large-scale, global, collaborative and competitive research.The LHCb group of La Salle is involved in applying machine-learning techniques for reconstruction and particle identification, analysis of radiative b-decays, and commissioning and operation of the detector with main focus on the calorimeter detector.Tasks:The PhD thesis work will include the development of new reconstruction and particle identification algorithms for future upgrades of the LHCb detector and detector related tasks. Some short research stays at CERN are also foreseen.The successful candidate will enrol to the doctoral program in Information Technologies and their Application to Management, Architecture and Geophysics of the Ramon Llull University.Research FieldApplied physics, Computer scienceEducation LevelMaster Degree or equivalentSkills/QualificationsMaster degree in the field of Physics, Data Science, AI or similar.To fulfill one of the following criteria to be admitted in a doctoral programme: A Spanish official Bachelor's degree or equivalent, as well as an official university Master's degree or equivalent, provided that a minimum of 300 ECTS credits have been completed with the combination of these degrees.Holder of degrees obtained under foreign education systems within the European Higher Education Area (EHEA), without the need for their homologation, provided that the degree certifies a level 7 on the European Qualifications Framework and grants access to doctoral studies in the country where it was issued.Holder of degrees obtained under non-EHEA foreign education systems, without the need for their homologation, subject to verification by the university that the degree attests to a level of training equivalent to that of the official Spanish university master's degree and grants access to doctoral studies in the country where the degree was issued.
