They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.Mews serves over 3,000 properties across more than 70 countries around the globe and works with a huge number of hotel tech partners to provide hoteliers with an unbeatable connectivity – no other solution offers as many integrations.At the 2020 HotelTechAwards, Mews was voted Best PMS by industry peers.

We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.Oh, and we love our pets ❤️.
